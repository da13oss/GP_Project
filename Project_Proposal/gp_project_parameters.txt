Project Name: MovieDB

Project Description: MovieDB website will serve as a comprehensive platform where users can search for and view detailed information about movies. 
This will include movie summaries, ratings, posters, and more, all fetched from the OMDb API. 
This project will encapsulate our knowledge of front-end and back-end development, database management, API integration, and more.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features:
- User Login, Registration
- User friendly frontend with easy to navigate site
- OMDb API integration, importing database details into the WebApp
- User Favorite movies page
- Modular Backend
Bonus Features: 
- User Profile editing
- User registration, password validation
- Movie Ratings
- Users can leave ratings for movies, maybe they should also be able to leave a review as well (with full CRUD), and this makes it so a user can only review and rate the same movie once; they can change their ratings and reviews if they wish, but no duplicate reviews.
